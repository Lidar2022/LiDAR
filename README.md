# Surveying and Real-time Asset and Inventory Management practices in Civil engineering are often associated with time consuming, labor intensive and financially demanding exercises. These exercises include manual inspections, disruption of traffic, safety concerns and the use of semi-automated equipment/technology that often results in inefficient data collection processes.
# The consequences of these inefficient processes are misallocation of resources, protracted projects, and reduction in profits. To alleviate this problem 2D detection algorithms have been utilized in the industry for data collection purposes.
# However, there are also limitations in using 2-D Object Detection Algorithms, as we are unable to capture the dimensionalities, localize the object position and understand the depth of the object. These problems are critical to object detection as cameras will only be able to depict the surroundings in 2D and they are also affected by lighting and weather conditions.
# In conclusion, surveying practices are still outdated and there is an immediate need to adopt 3D object detection algorithms to make accurate data driven decisions.â€‹

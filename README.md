# # The advent of autonomous driving has brought on innovation in the automotive industry, but also challenges. The most significant challenge is 3D object detection. The reason 3D object detection plays a fundamental role in the efficacy of autonomous driving is because without optimal 3D object detection it would be impossible to avoid collisions and accidents during autonomous driving. Currently, there are several algorithms that produce varying levels of effectiveness in object detection. Our project will be analyzing the architectural differences of these algorithms, identifying the strengths and shortcomings, and proposing ways to improve the algorithms. The goal of our project is to provide methods that will lead to higher levels of 3D object detection in the existing algorithms. We look forwarding to the researching, analyzing and hopefully providing improvements in the field of 3D object detection.
